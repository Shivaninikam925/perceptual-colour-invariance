# Research Question

* Human observers are able to recognize and judge colors as perceptually similar despite changes in illumination and contrast.

* This project asks: To what extent do common color representations exhibit invariance under illumination changes that preserve human perceptual similarity?

* We investigate whether a minimal learned representation can better capture perceptual stability than raw RGB and standard perceptual color spaces, under controlled illumination perturbations.

## Illumination Perturbations Considered

To isolate perceptual effects, we restrict attention to simple, controlled perturbations:

* Global brightness scaling

* Warm–cool color temperature shift

* Contrast scaling

These perturbations are chosen to be interpretable and to approximate common real-world lighting variations without introducing complex scene effects.
