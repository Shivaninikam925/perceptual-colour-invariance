# Definition of Perceptual Invariance

* In this project, perceptual invariance refers to the stability of pairwise similarity judgments between colors under controlled changes in illumination.

* Given two colors that are judged perceptually similar under a reference illumination, a representation is said to be invariant if the distance between their embeddings remains small under illumination perturbations.

Invariance is therefore operationalized as embedding stability, not classification accuracy.
