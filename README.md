# Perceptual Invariance in Human Color Judgement

This project investigates perceptual invariance in human color judgement under controlled illumination changes.

The goal is to analyze how different color representations (RGB, CIELAB, and a minimal learned embedding) preserve perceptual similarity when illumination varies, focusing on representation stability rather than classification performance.

This repository currently contains the formal research question and invariance definition. Experimental code and analysis will be added incrementally.
